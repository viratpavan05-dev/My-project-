What makes up winston?
As of winston@3 the project has been broken out into a few modules:

winston-transport: Transport stream implementation & legacy Transport wrapper.
logform: All formats exports through winston.format
LEVEL and MESSAGE symbols exposed through triple-beam.
Shared test suite for community transports
Let's dig in deeper. The example below has been annotated to demonstrate the different packages that compose the example itself:

const { createLogger, transports, format } = require('winston');
const Transport = require('winston-transport');
const logform = require('logform');
const { combine, timestamp, label, printf } = logform.format;

// winston.format is require('logform')
console.log(logform.format === format) // true

const logger = createLogger({
  format: combine(
    label({ label: 'right meow!' }),
    timestamp(),
    printf(({ level, message, label, timestamp }) => {
      return `${timestamp} [${label}] ${level}: ${message}`;
    })
  ),
  transports: [new transports.Console()]
});
