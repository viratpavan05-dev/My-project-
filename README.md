# Simple Interest Calculator

## 📝 Description
This is a lightweight command-line tool designed to calculate Simple Interest. It takes the Principal amount, Rate of interest, and Time period as inputs and outputs the total interest and the final amount payable.

## 🧮 The Formula
The program uses the standard mathematical formula for Simple Interest:

$$SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}$$

Where:
* **P** = Principal Amount (The initial sum of money)
* **R** = Annual Rate of Interest (in %)
* **T** = Time (in years)

## 🚀 Features
* Accepts floating-point numbers for precise calculations.
* Includes error handling for non-numeric inputs.
* Displays both the Interest generated and the Total Amount.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
* Python 3.x installed on your machine.
